js-brawl
========

A multiplayer brawl game. Where multiple players can join the battle and throw each other out of the ring.

Running it
---

Just cd to the project directory and execute
`node server

Note: You'll need nodejs installed.

Now you can go straight to http://127.0.0.1:1080 (for now you need to change the port in the code) and move the player

TODO
---
Everything? For now just the synchronisation (a very naive one btw) of the different positions and colours is working
So I'm expecting to add some nice animated sprites to the players and a button to "smack" other players.
